//! This module contains all structs related to the nbt data in the chunks
//!
//! Note: Many of the descriptions for the fields/structs in this module come directly from the
//! Minecraft Wiki, with some occasional modifications to make them make more sense (at least in
//! this context).  The latest update to these descriptions was on 5 March 2024, and I'll try to
//! keep them updated.
//!
//! &lt;rant&gt;  
//! Mojang has the worst naming conventions ever! Sometimes they use snake_case, sometimes they use
//! PascalCase, other times they use camelCase, sometimes it's SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE!  This is so
//! annoying when dealing with Mojang things!  Feel free to look at the name changes on _almost
//! every field in this module_ just to make it happy and you'll be just as annoyed as I am!  
//! &lt;/rant&gt;
